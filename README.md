Analyzing crypto currency opportunities for Accountability Accounting

## Overview

I took the crypto currency data cleaned it, scaled it, and clustered it for the benefit of visualization and better decision making on the part of Accountability Accounting. 

I was able to create a table to show the names of the coins, the total coins supplied as well as the number of mined coins. This information was broken up into four separate classes (0-3).

Finally I was able to create a scatter plot in order to help visualize the data.
